# **Project Title: Strategic Ad Campaign:**

# **Segment 25-30 Performance \& Opportunity**



### Executive Summary:



##### 1\. Risk Assessment of the Target Demographic



The age group of 25–30 does not represent an increased credit risk compared to other segments. Risk levels remain remarkably consistent across all age categories. It is important to note that our database is heavily skewed toward younger borrowers, with 76% of all clients being under the age of 30. Therefore, targeting this group is a logical step for our growth strategy.





##### 2\. Loan Intent Analysis



After evaluating our portfolio, we have identified several key trends:

Education: Demand drops sharply after age 24 as the population completes studies, making it an unattractive target for this age bracket.



Home Improvement: While showing initial growth around age 24, it remains stagnant at the bottom of the portfolio for this demographic. However, it maintains the highest average loan amount, making it a potential candidate for older categories.



Debt Consolidation: This segment is excluded from marketing promotion due to strategic reasons and its high-risk profile.





##### 3\. The "Medical" vs. "Venture" Contrast



While Medical loans dominate in terms of total volume and loan count, they present significant operational and financial challenges:

High Risk: Every 4th medical loan (26% risk) is problematic, resulting in high default rates.

Inefficiency: This segment has the lowest average ticket size, which increases the relative administrative processing costs per total volume.



In contrast, Venture loans offer a balanced and highly stable alternative:

Lowest Risk: With only a 14% default rate, it is the safest product in our portfolio.

Growth Potential: Demand for Venture loans typically dips before age 25 and rises again after age 30, signaling a clear gap and growth opportunity for the 25–30 demographic.





##### 4\. Final Recommendation



Although Personal loans currently slightly lead Venture loans in absolute numbers, the risk-adjusted returns favor the latter. Switching focus to Venture loans represents a 25% relative decrease in default rates compared to Personal loans, with a negligible difference in average loan amounts.



Recommendation: We recommend the Venture Loan segment as the primary target for the upcoming marketing campaign. It provides the best combination of professional stability, lowest default risk (86% repayment success), and high growth potential within the 25–30 age group.
